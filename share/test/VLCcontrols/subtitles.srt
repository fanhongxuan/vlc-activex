00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:12,223
Welcome back to the Dive Into Mark show!

2
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:13,384
We got a Roomba,

3
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:14,652
the dog is in hiding,

4
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:17,068
the kids are asleep,
and I finally shaved.

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,527
Mmmm... smooth.

6
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,606
In local news, the police installed
a speed trap right outside my house,

7
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,419
just in time for July 4th weekend.
Hey, thanks!

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,409
Unfortunately for them,
the tens digit is broken,

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,164
so it shows
"Your speed: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4..."

10
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:37,169
I feel safer already.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,025
Last week, Cory Doctorow of
BoingBoing.net

12
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:42,301
announced that he was also
switching to Ubuntu

13
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:44,209
after 22 years of servitude to Apple.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,477
I think I see the pattern.

15
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,234
Cory Doctorow is such a hard-core
Mac user that he actually has

16
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:54,125
a Sad Mac icon tattooed on his bicep.

17
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:57,404
And I thought I had migration problems.

18
00:00:57,605 --> 00:01:00,543
In response to last week's show,
Dan Ridley writes,

19
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:02,587
"Okay, I feel totally gypped.

20
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:04,278
I downloaded your video, watched it,

21
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:07,602
and at no point during the video
did I actually see bunnies."

22
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,830
Did I mention we got a Roomba?

23
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,841
It's totally awesome.

24
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,966
It was actually a birthday present
for my wife.

25
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,794
Don't look at me in that tone of voice.

26
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,106
It's what she asked for.

27
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:45,055
I tried to talk her out of it.

28
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:46,903
We're still trying to decide
what to name it,

29
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:50,092
but my wife has announced
that it is definitely a boy.

30
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,925
She says she knows it's a boy because
of the way it waggles its butt

31
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:54,786
when it goes back to its home base.

32
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:07,314
I went to BJ's this weekend to buy
a ridiculous amount of

33
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:08,588
everything

34
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,973
and I parked next to a car that had a
bumper sticker that read,

35
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:13,734
"Sorry I missed church,
I was busy practicing witchcraft

36
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:15,397
and becoming a lesbian."

37
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:18,240
Apparently, this has been a popular
bumper sticker for some time,

38
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:21,252
but living in North Carolina,
this is the first I've seen of it.
